# Arduino-ESP test

We believe that one of the greatest advantages of using Arduino Core is that we can use use various libraries from Arduino so our development can be easier. However, the drawback of Arduino core is that for many libraries, we don't really know how the functions are implemented. Furthermore, using FreeRTOS in Arduino IDE doesn't feel as natural as directly using it in ESP-IDF. So we decided to use ESP-IDF. However, we still want to see if it's possible to integrate Arduino libraries to our project.
